# Summer-2017-Arduino-Parking-Algorithm-Parking-Project

This code is from the research project I worked on over the at CSU Long Beach under the guidance of Dr. Oscar Morales.

This was one of my first programming projects, and you may notice my comments highlighting some concepts to build my understanding. I also went through and commented some of the different parts of the code and their role in the algorithm.

This code was done in Arduino envirnoment, and is compatible with an Arduino Duemilanove, seen here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDuemilanove

This was our final working code which allowed us to perform 3 different types of parallel parking excercises, which were horizontal parallel parking, and vertical parallel parking (While moving in reverse, and another while moving forward).

Any credit for this code is attributed to Dr. Oscar Morales. I was lucky enough to be able to work with him on it as a research assistant at CSU Long Beach, and look to continue our research so we can introduce this to a non-statice environment with the help of more autonomous tools.
