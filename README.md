# Summer-2017-Arduino-Parking-Algorithm-Parking-Project

This code is from the research project I worked on over the at CSU Long Beach under the guidance of Dr. Oscar Morales.

This code was done in Arduino envirnoment, and is compatible with an Arduino Duemilanove, seen here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDuemilanove

This was our final working code which allowed us to perform 3 different types of parallel parking excercises, which were horizontal parallel parking, and vertical parallel parking (While moving in reverse, and another while moving forward).

Thank you for looking!
